A simple portal to generate "open in Gitpod" links

## Contributing

There is a list of suggested repositories in `app/routes/index.tsx`. Feel free to make a pull request to add more. I am looking for 10-20 repositories that work well with Gitpod, with a preference for tutorial projects.

These may be removed at any time to make room for new ones or to change the design of the page.
